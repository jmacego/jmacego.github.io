# Resizer.sh

## DO NOT RUN WITHOUT INSTALLING IMAGEMAGICK FIRST
It will delete a bunch of your files, including resizer.sh

This is a bug and should be fixed.

## Installing Image Magick

### On Mac
```
brew install imagemagick
```

### On Debian/Ubuntu
```
sudo apt-get install imagemagick
```

## Running Resizer.sh
```
cd assets/images/posts/learning_series/
../../resizer.sh
```

Do not run the script without ImageMagick installed. Do not run it from `assets/images/` itself.
