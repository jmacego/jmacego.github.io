Coronavirus! Yeah, that's a thing right now. It's day 21 since I was asked to self-isolate and about 10 days since I was told I probably have it. So I've started a YouTube channel.

Before I got too sick, I started recording some videos of me soldering... after a long time without any practice. It's in line with the content that has been keeping me sane here.

Maybe watching me make a fool out of myself will make your day better. I hope it does.
