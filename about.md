## About Me

I’ve always clicked on *About Me* pages, too — so thanks for stopping by.

### Today

I’m currently **Senior Manager, Network Engineering Operations at The Walt Disney Studios**, where I lead global-scale infrastructure, network engineering, and operational transformation. My work has delivered major reductions in downtime, multi-million-dollar cost savings, and the rollout of next-generation datacenter architecture.  

Along the way I’ve also moved into the world of **AI and automation**. I’m an **inventor on U.S. Patent No. 12,360,789**, applying machine learning to optimize cloud networking file transfers, and recipient of the **Disney Inventor Award** for AI-driven network automation. These experiences gave me the skills and experience that I bring to consulting and advising organizations that need to modernize infrastructure, improve resilience, and turn around underperforming systems and teams.

### Recently

Professionally, I’ve spent 25+ years building, managing, and troubleshooting networks at scale. My career has spanned startups, international consulting, and global media networks. At Sohonet, I helped interconnect top film and media companies worldwide with BGP/MPLS solutions; at Disney, I’ve unified operations teams, integrated automation pipelines, and introduced AI/ML into production environments.  

I still enjoy getting hands-on with design and tools (yes, I’m one of those who actually enjoys working in Visio). You’ll find some helper scripts and snippets on my [GitHub gists](https://gist.github.com/jmacego/).

### Earlier

I'm a decade returned to technology after finding out that retiring in my 30s didn't work for me. When I came back, I pursued what some might call a “normal” engineering career — but my roots are anything but typical.  

I started in **1995 as co-founder of PowerSurge Technologies / FastServers.net**, a dotcom-era hosting and infrastructure startup. From there I went on to **build and run global consulting companies**, serving small and medium businesses, NGOs, and organizations that needed reliable systems but didn’t have Fortune 500 budgets.

Along the way, I also served as **President of Avitus Aviation Corp (2001–2010)**, where I gained firsthand experience in risk management, operations, and the culture of safety. Aviation underscored for me how process and procedures aren’t bureaucracy — they’re what save lives, and that lesson continues to shape my approach to system reliability and consulting today.

Those experiences gave me not just technical depth but also a **broad consulting toolkit**: listening to clients, tailoring solutions to scale, and turning technology into results. It’s a foundation I still draw on today when helping teams modernize or recover from setbacks.

### Personally

Outside of work, I cycle, tinker with embedded electronics, and build the occasional hobby project. I’m drawn to both the digital and analog worlds — from micropython on ESP32 chips to vacuum tube experiments.  

I’m also a **licensed pilot** with real-world aviation experience. Aviation has shaped my approach to systems thinking: checklists, crew resource management, and a no-fault culture of safety translate remarkably well into technology and consulting.  

And yes, I’ve also been a **Cisco-certified engineer** and an **international award-winning photographer**, which reflects the breadth of my interests.
