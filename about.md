## About Me

I've always clicked on *About Me* pages, too — so thanks for stopping by.

### Today

I'm a **serial entrepreneur and technology leader** now semi-retired and running multiple ventures. After six years leading network operations at The Walt Disney Studios, I've returned to what I love most: building and operating my own companies while selectively advising others.

Currently I'm **Fractional CTO at Equivalent Smart Graphics**, an AI-powered accessible SVG solutions company. I'm also exploring new ventures and taking on select consulting engagements in **leadership, AI/ML, and network architecture**.

I'm an **inventor on U.S. Patent No. 12,360,789**, applying machine learning to optimize cloud networking file transfers, and recipient of the **Disney Inventor Award** for AI-driven network automation.

### The Entrepreneurial Journey

I've founded and operated **5+ companies** across technology, aviation, photography, and retail:

- **Sheep's Clothing** (2010–2015): Built a specialty retail business from scratch to successful exit, growing revenue 10x.
- **Avitus Aviation Corp** (2001–2010): Founded and ran an aviation leasing company, managing aircraft, pilots, and operations.
- **Hyak Photography / Hyakdev.com** (2005–2010): Commercial photography and web development serving Pacific Northwest clients.
- **5GuysTech.com** (1997–2001): Managed services and web hosting during the dot-com boom.
- **PowerSurge Technologies / FastServers.net** (1995–1996): Co-founded one of the early dedicated server hosting companies.

These ventures taught me that technology is only part of the equation. Success comes from understanding customers, managing risk, building teams, and executing relentlessly.

### Corporate Leadership

Between entrepreneurial ventures, I spent 25+ years in corporate technology roles. At **Disney**, I unified fragmented operations teams, cut outages by 97%, and introduced AI/ML into production environments. At **Sohonet**, I interconnected top film and media companies worldwide with BGP/MPLS solutions spanning four continents.

I still enjoy getting hands-on with design and tools. You'll find some helper scripts and snippets on my [GitHub gists](https://gist.github.com/jmacego/).

### Aviation & Systems Thinking

I served as **President of Avitus Aviation Corp** and remain a **licensed pilot**. Aviation underscored how process and procedures aren't bureaucracy — they're what save lives. Checklists, crew resource management, and a no-fault culture of safety translate remarkably well into technology leadership and consulting.

### Personally

Outside of work, I cycle, tinker with embedded electronics, and build hobby projects. I'm drawn to both digital and analog worlds — from micropython on ESP32 chips to vacuum tube experiments.

I've also been a **Cisco-certified engineer** and an **international award-winning photographer**, reflecting the breadth of my interests.

### Work With Me

I'm selectively available for:
- **Fractional CTO/leadership** roles for growing companies
- **Consulting** on network architecture, AI/ML, and operational transformation
- **Advisory** for technology startups
