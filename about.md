## About Me

I’ve always clicked on *About Me* pages, too — so thanks for stopping by.

### Today

I’m currently **Senior Manager, Network Engineering Operations at The Walt Disney Studios**, where I lead global-scale infrastructure, network engineering, and operational transformation. My work has delivered major reductions in downtime, multi-million-dollar cost savings, and the rollout of next-generation datacenter architecture.  

Along the way I’ve also moved into the world of **AI and automation**. I’m an **inventor on U.S. Patent No. 12,360,789**, applying machine learning to optimize cloud networking file transfers, and recipient of the **Disney Inventor Award** for AI-driven network automation. These experiences now fuel my growing focus on **consulting and advising organizations** that need to modernize infrastructure, improve resilience, and turn around underperforming systems and teams.

### Recently

Professionally, I’ve spent 25+ years building, managing, and troubleshooting networks at scale. My career has spanned startups, international consulting, and global media networks. At Sohonet, I helped interconnect top film and media companies worldwide with BGP/MPLS solutions; at Disney, I’ve unified operations teams, integrated automation pipelines, and introduced AI/ML into production environments.  

I still enjoy getting hands-on with design and tools (yes, I’m one of those who actually enjoys working in Visio). You’ll find some helper scripts and snippets on my [GitHub gists](https://gist.github.com/jmacego/).

### Personally

Outside of work, I cycle, tinker with embedded electronics, and build the occasional hobby project. I’m drawn to both the digital and analog worlds — from micropython on ESP32 chips to vacuum tube experiments.  

I’ve also been a **Cisco-certified engineer** and an **international award-winning photographer**, which reflects the breadth of my interests.
