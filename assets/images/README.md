# Resizer.sh

## DO NOT RUN WITHOUT INSTALLING IMAGEMAGICK FIRST
It will delete a bunch of your files, including resizer.sh

This is a bug and should be fixed.

## Installing Image Magick

### On Mac
```
port install imagemagick
```

### On Debian/Ubuntu
```
port install imagemagick
```

## Running Resizer.sh
```
./resizer.sh
```
