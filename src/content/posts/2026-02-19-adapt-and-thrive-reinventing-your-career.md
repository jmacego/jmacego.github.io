On paper, my career doesn't have an obvious through-line. Web hosting company co-founder. Aviation leasing entrepreneur. Specialty retail operator. Enterprise IT executive. Fractional technology consultant.

These are not the resume of someone who found a lane and stayed in it. They're the record of someone who repeatedly concluded that the most interesting thing to do next was something genuinely different — and then did it.

I've been asked whether this was a deliberate strategy or a series of fortunate accidents. The honest answer is: mostly the latter, occasionally the former, and in retrospect impossible to fully distinguish. But I've learned enough from the experience to say something useful about what enables successful transitions across industries.

## The Moves

**1995–2001: Web hosting and the early internet.** Co-founding a web hosting company in 1995 meant building infrastructure for an industry that barely existed yet. We made it up as we went, learned from every failure, and experienced the full arc of the dot-com era from inside. By 2001, the landscape had changed enough that the next chapter made sense.

**Aviation leasing.** I've held a pilot's license for most of my adult life. Aviation has always been a deep interest. At a certain point I had an opportunity to do something in the business of aviation itself — not just fly as a hobby but participate in the commercial side of the industry. That required learning a specialized domain with its own vocabulary, regulatory environment, financial logic, and relationship networks. I was starting over in a very specific sense.

**Specialty retail: Sheep's Clothing.** Building a specialty retail business from scratch is one of the more humbling things I've done. Retail is relentless and immediate. Every day, customers either respond to what you're offering or they don't. There's nowhere to hide from the market. We built the business to a successful exit, but not without a sustained education in what it actually means to run an operation that depends on face-to-face customer experience.

**Enterprise IT at Disney.** After running my own ventures, taking an executive role at a large organization meant learning to operate through institutions rather than around them. Different constraints, different leverage points, different time horizons. A genuinely different skill set in some respects, even if the underlying problems — technology strategy, team leadership, operational reliability — were familiar.

**Fractional CTO.** The current chapter, which draws on everything that came before.

## What Actually Transfers

Most people, when they think about transferable skills, think about technical capabilities. Can my coding skills transfer? Can my financial modeling? Can my specific domain expertise?

That's the wrong question. Those skills usually transfer partially, often depreciate quickly in a new context, and rarely explain successful transitions.

What actually transfers:

**Problem decomposition.** The ability to look at a complex, ambiguous situation and figure out what the actual problem is — not the presenting symptom, not the stated concern, but the underlying thing that needs to be addressed. This is valuable in every domain. It's one of the reasons people with diverse backgrounds often make strong consultants and advisors: they've developed a domain-agnostic version of this skill.

**Building trust quickly.** Every time you enter a new industry, you're unknown. Your credentials don't transfer the way they do within a field. The ability to establish credibility and trust with unfamiliar people — to listen carefully, demonstrate you understand their context, and earn respect through behavior rather than titles — becomes essential.

**Managing through ambiguity.** When you're new to a field, you don't have the comfort of deep expertise. You're operating with incomplete information, making judgment calls you're not fully confident in, and staying functional in conditions of uncertainty. People who have done this multiple times get better at it.

**Understanding what you don't know.** Experienced people in any field have strong opinions about how things work. Sometimes those opinions are correct. Sometimes they're artifacts of that specific field's culture or history that don't apply outside it. Knowing which is which — and being willing to have your assumptions challenged — is critical when you're a newcomer trying to operate effectively.

## What Requires Genuine Courage

The thing that career-transition advice often skips over is the emotional reality of starting over.

When you've established yourself in a field, you have a social and professional identity built around that expertise. People know who you are and what you do. You know where you stand. You have the psychological comfort of competence.

Entering a new field means giving that up — at least temporarily. You're unknown. You're making mistakes that more experienced people find obvious. You're absorbing more than you're contributing. That's genuinely uncomfortable, and the discomfort doesn't go away just because you remind yourself that it's temporary.

The leaders I've watched fail at transitions — and I've watched a few — usually fail not because they lacked the capability to succeed in the new domain, but because they couldn't tolerate the discomfort of the learning curve. They tried to reassert the identity they had in their previous field rather than genuinely apprenticing to the new one. They brought the answers before they understood the questions.

The willingness to be a beginner — to sit with the discomfort of not knowing, to ask questions you're slightly embarrassed not to already know the answers to, to do the unglamorous work of learning a new domain at depth — is the real prerequisite.

## The Unexpected Benefits

The things I learned in retail make me a better technology leader. Not metaphorically — concretely. Understanding what it actually feels like for a customer to interact with a product or service, having seen it up close in a context where the feedback is immediate and unfiltered, has shaped how I think about user experience in software systems.

Aviation gave me a framework for operational discipline and safety culture that I've applied in data center management and now in consulting. The checklist culture, the no-blame incident investigation, the commitment to procedures even when they feel like friction — these ideas travel.

The cross-domain perspective is itself a capability. When you've seen the same problem pattern in multiple industries, you recognize it faster. When you've seen the same mistake made in different contexts, you can warn against it with more credibility. The unusual career path becomes an asset rather than an explanation to be made.

But you have to actually go through the transitions to get there. The benefit doesn't accrue to people who talk about being curious and generalist while staying safely in their lane.

## For Whoever Needs to Hear This

If you're considering a significant career transition and feeling afraid that you don't have the right credentials or background, the question isn't whether you're qualified in the traditional sense. It's whether you have the adaptability, the humility to learn, and the patience to earn credibility in a new context.

Those qualities are rarer than credentials. And they're almost entirely within your control.
