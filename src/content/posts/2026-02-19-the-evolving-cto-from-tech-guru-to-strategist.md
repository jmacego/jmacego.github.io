When I started my career in the technology industry, the person at the top of the technology function was usually the best technologist in the room. They had deep expertise in specific domains — hardware, networking, software architecture — and their authority derived from that technical depth. The organization came to them with technical problems and they solved them.

That role still exists in some organizations and some contexts. But it's increasingly not what "CTO" means — especially in growth-stage companies, enterprises, and organizations where technology is strategically important. The role has evolved, and the evolution is significant enough that someone being groomed for a CTO role in 2026 needs a fundamentally different preparation than someone who was being groomed for one in 1996.

Here's how I've watched the role change, what I think it means, and what anyone aspiring to a technology executive role needs to understand about the current landscape.

## What the Role Was

In the early era of corporate technology leadership — roughly through the 1990s and into the 2000s — the typical CTO or equivalent senior tech leader had a few core responsibilities:

**Infrastructure ownership.** You owned the physical and logical infrastructure that made the organization's systems run. Servers, networks, data centers, security perimeters. You made the technical decisions, you managed the vendors, you kept the lights on.

**Technical architecture.** You were the final authority on how systems were designed and how they fit together. Architectural decisions came to you because you had the deepest understanding of the constraints and trade-offs.

**Engineering leadership.** You managed the engineers — either directly or through a thin management layer. Technical credibility with the team was essential, because the team needed to believe you understood what they were doing and could evaluate their work.

**Vendor and procurement management.** You decided what technology to buy, negotiated with vendors, and managed the technology portfolio.

This is a meaningful job. It's still a meaningful job, in many organizations. But it's increasingly not sufficient.

## What Changed

Several forces transformed what organizations need from technology leadership.

**Technology became strategically central.** In most industries, the technology strategy and the business strategy are now largely the same thing. A bank's competitive position is largely determined by its technology capabilities. A retailer's customer experience is largely determined by its technology. A healthcare organization's ability to serve patients is increasingly mediated by software. When technology is this central to business outcomes, the person leading technology has to think like a business leader, not a specialist.

**The pace of change accelerated.** The technology decisions that a CTO makes today have a shorter half-life than the decisions of 20 years ago. Cloud computing, AI, new security threat landscapes — the environment changes fast enough that a CTO can't rely on deep expertise in any specific stack or architecture. The ability to reason well about unfamiliar technology choices, and to do it quickly, matters more than mastery of today's tools.

**The audience for technology leadership expanded.** CTOs now spend substantial time communicating with investors, boards, customers, and partners — audiences that are often not technical. The ability to translate technology strategy into business language is a first-order skill, not a nice-to-have.

**The organizational scope broadened.** Modern CTOs are often involved in M&A technology due diligence, in go-to-market strategy (especially for technology products), in security and compliance strategy, and in innovation pipeline management. These are business functions that happen to have strong technology dimensions, and the CTO is a participant in them, not just a technical advisor.

## What Today's CTO Actually Does

The modern CTO role, at least in organizations where technology is strategically central, looks more like this:

**Technology strategy aligned to business outcomes.** Not "here's our infrastructure roadmap" but "here's how our technology investments will create competitive advantage, enable growth, and reduce risk over the next three years." This requires understanding the business deeply enough to make those connections credibly.

**Capital allocation and prioritization.** Technology budgets are significant, and the decisions about where to invest — building vs. buying, investing in infrastructure vs. product development, allocating between maintenance and new capabilities — have major business implications. The CTO needs to make and defend these allocations in business terms.

**External-facing leadership.** More CTOs are expected to represent the organization externally: speaking at conferences, engaging with customers and partners on technology strategy, contributing to industry conversations. Technical depth still matters, but so does the ability to communicate to external audiences.

**Innovation leadership.** Identifying how emerging technologies could be applied to the organization's specific context — not just as theoretical capability but as practical business opportunity — has become a central CTO function. This is partly about AI today; it will be about something else in five years.

**People strategy.** With engineering talent as a critical constraint for most technology-dependent organizations, the CTO's role in attracting, developing, and retaining technical talent has expanded significantly.

## What Aspiring CTOs Need to Develop

The implication for people who want to become CTOs is that a deep technical track record is necessary but not sufficient.

**Business acumen.** Understand how businesses work: how they generate revenue, how costs flow, how investments are evaluated, what matters to investors and boards. This doesn't require an MBA, but it requires genuine engagement with the business side of the organization — not just the technology side.

**Communication across audiences.** Develop the ability to explain technical concepts and trade-offs to non-technical stakeholders in terms that are accurate, accessible, and relevant. Practice this in your current role by volunteering to present technology topics to non-technical audiences.

**Strategic thinking.** Learn to reason about markets, competitive dynamics, and long-term positioning. The best CTOs I know think about technology choices in terms of their strategic implications, not just their technical merits.

**Emotional intelligence and organizational savvy.** CTOs work across the organization in ways that junior technical leaders often don't. Navigating organizational dynamics, building relationships with peers in other functions, and influencing without authority are all skills that need development.

**Tolerance for ambiguity.** The higher you go in an organization, the less well-defined the problems are. Developing comfort with making decisions under uncertainty — and with being wrong sometimes — is a prerequisite for effective executive leadership.

The CTO who was most effective 20 years ago was the best technologist in the building. The CTO who is most effective today is a business leader who happens to have deep technology fluency. The path to that role runs through both the technical and the organizational — and the earlier you start developing both, the better positioned you'll be when the opportunity arrives.
