The move to distributed work that accelerated after 2020 didn't create new leadership challenges so much as it amplified existing ones and made previously optional skills mandatory.

The leaders who adapted well to remote and hybrid environments weren't the ones who found the best Zoom backgrounds. They were the ones who had already internalized that clarity, communication, and trust are the actual foundations of team effectiveness — and who could rebuild those foundations in a different medium.

After managing distributed teams across multiple companies, through multiple configurations, here's what I've learned about what actually works.

## What Changes in Distributed Work

**Accidental communication disappears.** In co-located environments, enormous amounts of coordination happen through informal channels: the hallway conversation, the overheard discussion, the visual cue that someone is frustrated or confused. These channels evaporate in distributed work. The communication that used to happen automatically now has to happen deliberately. Teams that don't build intentional channels for this coordination become fragmented.

**The legibility of effort decreases.** When you can observe your team working, you have implicit evidence of engagement and effort even if you're not tracking it explicitly. When the team is distributed, that implicit evidence disappears. Leaders who managed through presence — who felt confident things were going well because they could see the office was busy — have to build different confidence mechanisms.

**The asymmetry between time zones creates structural challenges.** A team spread across multiple time zones has less natural overlap for synchronous work. Decisions that could happen in a quick hallway conversation now require scheduled meetings that participants may be attending at inconvenient hours. This isn't insurmountable, but it changes how work gets designed.

**Culture becomes harder to transmit.** Organizational culture is partly transmitted through observation — watching how senior people behave, what gets celebrated, what gets criticized. When junior team members can't observe senior team members in the ambient way that co-location enables, intentional culture transmission becomes necessary.

## What Works: Communication Infrastructure

The single highest-leverage investment a distributed team can make is in deliberate communication infrastructure. This doesn't mean more meetings — in fact, distributed teams that default to synchronous meetings for everything create enormous coordination burdens. It means intentional structures that ensure the right information reaches the right people without requiring synchronous availability.

**Written communication as a first-class capability.** Teams that write well — that document decisions with context and rationale, that write crisp project updates, that communicate asynchronously with enough clarity that recipients can act without follow-up — outperform teams that rely on verbal communication followed by meeting recaps. This is a skill that has to be developed and practiced, and it deserves explicit investment.

**Structured asynchronous updates.** Regular written updates — team status reports, individual progress summaries, project health indicators — create shared awareness without requiring everyone to be online simultaneously. The format matters less than the consistency. Teams that know they'll get a clear picture of what's happening every week can work with more autonomy between updates.

**Intentional synchronous time, used well.** Not every communication should be asynchronous. The meetings that remain should be reserved for things that genuinely benefit from real-time interaction: complex problem-solving, emotional conversations, relationship-building, and decisions that need input from multiple people simultaneously. Using synchronous time for things that could be asynchronous is one of the most common — and most expensive — coordination failures in distributed work.

**Documentation that doesn't rely on memory.** Decisions made in meetings should be documented with the reasoning, not just the outcome. Code should be written with the expectation that someone who wasn't in the original design conversations will need to maintain it. Processes should be written down precisely enough that someone can follow them without needing to ask. This requires more work upfront and pays compounding dividends over time.

## What Works: Trust and Accountability

The trust question in distributed work is often framed as "how do I know my team is actually working?" This is the wrong question. It's the question of surveillance, not leadership.

The better question is: "How do I create conditions where my team can do their best work, and how do I know whether those conditions are working?"

The answer is outcomes, not activity. What has the team delivered? Are goals being met? Are problems being surfaced and addressed? Is the team healthy — are people engaged and not burning out? These are the signals that matter. Tracking keystroke counts and application usage to verify that people are sitting at their computers is a category error: it measures the wrong thing, and it damages the trust that effective distributed work requires.

What accountability actually looks like in distributed work:

- Clear, measurable goals with reasonable timelines
- Regular check-ins focused on progress, blockers, and help needed — not on monitoring activity
- A culture where surfacing problems early is rewarded and hiding them is costly
- Consistent follow-through on commitments from both leaders and team members

Trust builds through accumulated demonstrated reliability, in both directions. Leaders who reliably follow through on their commitments to their teams earn the trust that makes distributed accountability work.

## What Works: Culture and Connection

Culture in distributed teams doesn't happen automatically. It requires deliberate investment.

**Regular video time that's not purely work-focused.** The casual conversation that happens in a co-located office needs an analog in distributed work. Informal all-hands sessions, virtual coffee chats, team rituals that are genuinely human rather than purely professional — these feel forced initially and become genuinely valued over time.

**In-person time when possible.** Most distributed teams benefit from periodic in-person gatherings, even if they're not frequent. The relationship density that emerges from spending time together physically is hard to replicate entirely through screens, and it pays dividends in the quality of remote collaboration that follows.

**Explicit attention to who's visible and who isn't.** Distributed teams have visibility disparities — some team members are more present in synchronous channels and therefore more visible to leadership, while others do excellent work that doesn't naturally surface in the same way. Equitable recognition requires actively seeking out and acknowledging contributions that aren't self-promoting.

**Manager one-on-ones that include personal check-ins.** In a co-located environment, you pick up information about how people are doing through ambient observation. In distributed work, you have to ask. Regular one-on-ones should include explicit attention to how people are doing beyond their current project status — workload, energy level, work-life integration, professional development. This is part of the manager's job, not a soft optional.

## The Hybrid Complexity

Hybrid work — some team members co-located, others remote — introduces an additional complexity that often doesn't get enough attention: the risk of two-tier team dynamics.

When some team members are in the office and others are not, the in-office members naturally have better access to informal communication, relationship-building with leadership, and the spontaneous collaboration that produces ideas. Remote members, even in organizations that are genuinely committed to inclusion, tend to be at a disadvantage in these dynamics.

The mitigation requires active effort: ensuring that remote team members have equivalent access to decision-making conversations, that their contributions are visible, and that the cultural artifacts of the team (how decisions get made, how recognition happens, how the team builds shared understanding) are designed for remote participation rather than for in-office participation with remote as an afterthought.

"Remote-first" is the design principle that works: build communication and collaboration infrastructure that works well for the distributed case, and the co-located members adapt easily. Build for the co-located case and expect remote members to adapt — and you've created structural inequity that will eventually manifest in retention problems.

## The Honest Assessment

Distributed work has expanded access to opportunities for people who can't or don't want to be tied to a specific geography. That's a real and significant benefit. It has also made certain aspects of leadership harder — particularly the relationship-building, culture transmission, and informal coordination that co-location facilitated naturally.

The leaders who are most effective in distributed environments are not those who pretend the challenges don't exist or who try to replicate the co-located experience through more video calls. They're the ones who honestly assess what's harder, build deliberate structures to address those specific challenges, and accept that some things will work differently rather than trying to force them to work the same.

That's just good leadership, applied to a new context. Which is, ultimately, what leadership always is.
