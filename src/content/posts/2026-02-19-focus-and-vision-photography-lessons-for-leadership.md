I've been a serious photographer for most of my adult life — long enough to have won international awards and to have developed a genuine practice around it, not just a hobby I pick up occasionally.

When I tell people this alongside my work as a technology executive, they tend to treat them as separate things — the artistic pursuit and the professional one. But I've found that the two inform each other in specific, practical ways. Photography has taught me things about leadership that I couldn't have learned from a management book.

Here's what I mean.

## The Zoom: Strategic vs. Operational Thinking

Every photographer learns to work with different focal lengths. A wide angle takes in the whole scene, giving you context, relationships, the way the elements fit together. A telephoto compresses and isolates, revealing details that are invisible at wider perspective.

Neither is better. Both are necessary. The skill is knowing when each is right.

Leadership requires exactly the same kind of focal length management. Strategic thinking is wide-angle: where are we going, what does the landscape look like, how do the pieces relate to each other, what's our position in the larger environment? Operational thinking is telephoto: what specifically is this team doing right now, where is the friction, what needs to happen in the next sprint?

The failure mode I see most often in technology leaders is getting stuck at one focal length. Leaders who are perpetually strategic miss the operational reality that undermines their strategy. Leaders who are perpetually operational miss the strategic shifts that will make their day-to-day work irrelevant.

The discipline is developing the habit of deliberately switching perspective — asking yourself, in a given moment, whether you're using the right focal length for this conversation or this decision. A useful question I've borrowed from photography: am I close enough to see what matters, or far enough back to see what's around it?

## Patience and the Right Moment

Photography rewards patience in ways that aren't intuitive when you're starting out. The impulse is to shoot constantly and hope something works. What works better — especially in landscape, wildlife, or street photography — is to observe, wait, understand the scene, and then act decisively at the right moment.

This is slow. You might spend an hour in a location before anything happens that's worth capturing. Many beginners find this frustrating and conclude that they missed the shot by waiting.

The experienced photographer knows that the shot you force at minute five is almost never as good as the shot you wait for at minute forty. The difference is willingness to observe before acting.

Leadership decisions have a similar dynamic. The instinct under pressure — and technology leadership involves constant pressure — is to decide quickly and move on. Speed is valued. Decisiveness is valued. But the decisions that required more observation before they were made are reliably better than the ones that were made to relieve the discomfort of ambiguity.

I've learned to ask myself: am I making this decision now because the moment is right, or because waiting is uncomfortable? The answers are different, and the decisions that follow should be different.

## Seeing What's Actually There

One of the most useful things photography teaches is careful observation. To take a good photograph, you have to see what's actually in front of you — not what you assume is there, not what you expected to see, but what's actually there. Shadows where you didn't expect them. Light behaving differently than you planned. A detail that changes the meaning of the whole composition.

Technology leaders who are good observers see their organizations clearly. They notice the thing that's not being said in the meeting. They see the friction that teams have normalized. They catch the early signal of a developing problem before it becomes a crisis.

This kind of observation has to be cultivated deliberately. It's easy to walk through an organization seeing what you expect to see — confirming your existing mental model rather than genuinely observing. The discipline of actually looking, with fresh eyes, at what's happening in front of you is something photography trains in a concrete way.

## Light Changes Everything

The same subject photographed in different light looks completely different. A landscape at midday is flat and undifferentiated. The same landscape at golden hour has depth, warmth, dimension. The photographer's job isn't just to find interesting subjects — it's to understand how the light interacts with the subject.

Context in leadership works this way. The same proposal, the same person, the same decision looks entirely different depending on the context in which it's encountered. A team that seems resistant to change during a period of organizational uncertainty is not the same as a team that's resistant during a stable, trusted environment. The recommendation that makes sense after a successful product launch needs different evaluation after a failure.

I try to be aware of the light I'm seeing situations in. What's the current context for this team, this person, this organization? Am I seeing clearly, or is the light misleading me about what's actually there?

## Composition: What You Leave Out

A photograph is defined as much by what's excluded from the frame as by what's included. The discipline of composition is partly the discipline of subtraction — deciding what not to include so that what remains can be seen clearly.

Leadership and strategy benefit from the same discipline. The organizations I've seen struggle most often weren't struggling because they lacked good ideas or capable people. They were struggling because they were trying to do too many things simultaneously, and nothing was getting done well.

Knowing what to leave out of the frame — which initiatives to not pursue, which meetings to not take, which opportunities to decline — is one of the highest-leverage skills a leader can develop. It's also one of the hardest, because everything that gets excluded feels like a loss in the moment.

The photograph that tries to include everything is not a composition — it's a snapshot. The strategy that tries to pursue everything is not a strategy — it's a list.

## Experimentation and the Willingness to Get It Wrong

Photography, especially with digital technology, enables rapid experimentation. Shoot, review, adjust. The feedback loop is immediate. This encourages a certain kind of creative courage: try the unusual angle, the unexpected composition, the unfamiliar light. Most experiments don't work. Some do, and the ones that do would never have emerged from staying with safe, predictable choices.

The best technology organizations have this quality. They're willing to try things that might not work, at an appropriate scale, with fast feedback loops. They've built cultures where experimentation is expected and failure is treated as information rather than judgment.

This isn't a revolutionary insight — "fail fast" has been tech culture's mantra for years. But the photography connection makes the underlying dynamic concrete for me. Creativity requires experimentation. Experimentation requires accepting that most experiments won't work. The willingness to take that shot, knowing most of them won't be the one, is what produces the occasional image that makes the whole practice worthwhile.

The same willingness, in technology leadership, is what produces the occasional breakthrough.
