In 1995, I co-founded a web hosting company. At the time, most people didn't have a clear mental model of what the internet was going to become, but we were certain it was going to be enormous. We were right about that. We were wrong about a lot of the specifics.

By 2001, the landscape had changed completely. The dot-com bubble had inflated spectacularly, then deflated with equal spectacle. A lot of companies that had seemed unstoppable were gone. Some that had seemed modest were still standing.

I've been thinking about that period more as I watch today's AI hype cycle. History doesn't repeat, but it rhymes. Here's what I saw up close from 1995 to 2001, and what I think it means for people building things today.

## The Atmosphere at the Peak

If you weren't there, it's hard to convey how strange the peak of the dot-com era felt from the inside. The money was flowing in ways that seemed to defy gravity. Companies with no revenue were going public and being valued at hundreds of millions of dollars. "Eyeballs" — the number of people visiting your website — was seriously discussed as a primary business metric, as though ad revenue would eventually arrive by magic if you could only accumulate enough users.

I remember conversations with investors who were more concerned about whether we were growing fast enough than whether we were building a real business. The implicit assumption was that growth trumped everything, that market share was all that mattered, that monetization was a problem for later. We'd figure it out when we got there.

Some of that thinking infected us, even though we were in a more fundamentally sound business than many of our contemporaries. Web hosting was real infrastructure with paying customers. But we still made decisions oriented around growth at the expense of operational discipline that we later regretted.

## The Specific Mistakes

**Spending as though the bull market was permanent.** Hiring ahead of revenue, leasing space at prices that made sense only if growth continued indefinitely, investing in capabilities that weren't necessary at our actual scale. When the market turned, a lot of that spending couldn't be unwound quickly enough.

**Measuring the wrong things.** Traffic, growth rate, press mentions — these were the metrics that felt important because they were the metrics the market seemed to reward. The metrics that actually predicted survival — customer lifetime value, unit economics, retention — were harder to track and less exciting to talk about.

**Competitive anxiety driving bad decisions.** When you see competitors growing rapidly and raising money, there's enormous pressure to match them — to move faster, spend more, expand into adjacent markets before you've mastered your core one. Some of that expansion was premature for us, and when the environment changed, the stretched commitments became vulnerabilities.

**Assuming the tailwind was strategy.** When everything is going up because an entire sector is in a bubble, it's easy to mistake good fortune for good execution. Some of what we did was genuinely smart. Some of it was just surfing the wave. The crash made it very clear which was which.

## What the Bust Revealed

The businesses that survived 2001-2002 shared certain characteristics.

They had real customers paying real money for things they genuinely needed. Not "eyeballs" or "users" but actual customers with real retention and real willingness to pay.

They had cost structures that could sustain themselves through a downturn. They hadn't built operations on the assumption of perpetual growth.

They had leadership that understood the difference between growth and sustainability and was willing to make the harder choices — slowing expansion, cutting costs before it became a crisis, prioritizing profitability over market share.

And most of them were less celebrated than the companies that imploded. They were building something slower, less glamorous, and more durable. The press wasn't particularly interested in them during the boom years. They're still operating today.

## What I See Repeating

I'm not making a specific prediction about the current AI investment cycle. But some patterns feel familiar.

Valuations that outrun demonstrated business value. A gold-rush mentality where infrastructure companies (then: web hosting, bandwidth, servers; now: GPU compute, cloud AI APIs) make out regardless of which specific applications survive. A general atmosphere where the failure to move quickly enough is treated as a more serious risk than moving poorly.

The specific technology is different. The underlying human dynamics of boom-cycle investment are not.

## What I'd Tell Someone Building Today

Build for customers, not for investors. These are not always the same thing, and when they diverge, it's worth noticing.

Know your unit economics. Not eventually — now. Even at early stage, you should have a story about what it costs to acquire a customer and what that customer is worth over time.

Treat growth as one metric among several, not as the metric. Growing in ways that destroy margin, require constant capital infusion, or build organizational complexity you can't sustain is not actually good growth.

Be skeptical of competitive panic. The pressure to match a competitor's moves is real, but competitors burning through capital faster than you isn't evidence you're losing — it might be evidence they're making worse decisions than you.

Prepare for the environment to change. Not by being pessimistic, but by ensuring that your business can survive a significant change in conditions. The companies that survived 2001 were the ones that had prepared for that possibility even when everything was going well.

The dot-com boom was one of the most energizing and disorienting periods of my professional life. I learned more in those six years than in any equivalent period before or since. I'm grateful for it, including the bust. The downturn clarified things that the boom had obscured.

Building durable businesses is slower and less exciting than building for a hype cycle. It's also far more likely to result in something that matters.
