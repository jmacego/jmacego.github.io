I am a published knitting pattern author. This is perhaps the most unexpected sentence I could write in a piece about technology leadership, so let me explain why it belongs here.

Over the years, I've come to believe that knitting and software development share more structural similarities than most people would guess — and that the skills I developed as a knitter transferred to coding and leadership in ways that weren't metaphorical. They were concrete. The pattern thinking, the debugging approach, the attention to detail, and the relationship between following instructions precisely and knowing when to deviate from them: all of it applies.

## Patterns as Programs

A knitting pattern is, in important ways, a program. It's a set of instructions that, if followed correctly and completely, produces a deterministic output. "K2tog" (knit two together) is a function call with a predictable result. A pattern for a cable sweater specifies the exact sequence of operations, repeated across rows and columns, that produces a specific fabric structure.

This means that reading a knitting pattern requires the same skills as reading code: understanding notation, tracking state across iterations, predicting how local operations will affect global structure. An experienced knitter looks at a pattern for a complex lace shawl and understands the relationship between each instruction and the eventual shape of the finished piece. An experienced programmer looks at code and understands how each function contributes to the system's behavior.

Both also involve pattern libraries. Knitters accumulate a mental library of standard techniques — basic stitches, increase and decrease methods, join techniques, finishing approaches. Developers accumulate design patterns — standard solutions to recurring problems. In both cases, the value of the library is that you recognize when a known pattern applies and can deploy a tested solution rather than inventing from scratch.

## The Dropped Stitch

Every knitter knows the particular anxiety of discovering a dropped stitch several rows after it happened. A single missed loop, unnoticed in the moment, propagates through subsequent work in ways that become increasingly visible over time. The longer you wait to address it, the more it has affected, and the harder it is to correct without ripping back significant work.

This is an almost perfect analogy for technical debt and software bugs. A flawed assumption early in a system's design creates problems that are minor and localized at first, then increasingly difficult and expensive to address as more code is built on top of that flawed foundation. The dropped stitch that costs two minutes to fix in row 12 can require ripping out a week of work in row 150.

Both knitting and software development have taught me to notice problems early and address them immediately rather than hoping they'll resolve themselves or become less important. They don't. They compound.

## Frogging: The Cost of Undoing

"Frogging" is knitting slang for ripping out completed work — the term comes from the sound of undoing stitches (rip-it, rip-it). It's sometimes necessary. A mistake that can't be fixed in place has to be backed out.

Experienced knitters develop judgment about when to frog and when to work around a problem. Minor imperfections in a highly textured fabric might be invisible in the finished piece and not worth ripping back 20 rows. A structural error in the shaping of a sleeve requires ripping, because working around it will compound the problem.

Software developers face exactly the same decisions. Refactoring versus working around technical debt. Rearchitecting versus extending the existing system. The judgment required is similar: is this error minor enough to accept, or will it prevent the system from working correctly at scale? Is the cost of undoing and redoing less than the cumulative cost of leaving the problem in place?

I've made both kinds of decisions, in both domains, and I've made them wrong in both directions. The pattern I've observed is that the cases where I deferred addressing a structural problem because the immediate fix seemed too costly almost always became more expensive, not less, over time.

## Following the Pattern vs. Understanding the Pattern

Beginning knitters follow patterns literally. They do exactly what the instructions say, in exactly the order given, and don't deviate. This works until something goes wrong or until they need to modify the pattern for their specific situation.

Experienced knitters understand patterns — why each instruction is there, what problem it solves, what would happen if it were done differently. This understanding enables modification, adaptation, and troubleshooting when the instructions don't quite work.

The parallel in software is the difference between code that works and code that's understood. A developer who follows a tutorial step-by-step and gets a working result is doing something useful. A developer who understands why each step is necessary can adapt when the context changes, recognize when a standard pattern doesn't apply, and debug when something goes wrong.

Leadership has the same dynamic. There are frameworks, methodologies, and best practices in every domain. Following them literally produces mediocre results, because they were designed for a typical situation that may not be yours. Understanding them — knowing the problem each practice was designed to solve, and therefore when it applies and when it doesn't — is what produces good results in specific contexts.

## Finishing: The Underappreciated Work

In knitting, "finishing" refers to all the work that happens after the main knitting is done: weaving in ends, blocking the fabric, seaming pieces together, adding buttons or closures. Finishing is unglamorous and time-consuming, and many knitters undervalue it. They spend weeks on a sweater and then rush through the finishing, producing a result that looks sloppy despite technically correct knitting.

Software has exactly this phenomenon. The last 20% of a project — documentation, edge case handling, performance optimization, testing, deployment infrastructure — feels less interesting than the core development work and often receives less attention than it deserves. The result is systems that are technically functional but poorly documented, inconsistently tested, and hard to operate in production.

The lesson from knitting: finishing is part of the craft, not an afterthought. The quality of the finished piece depends on both the knitting and the finishing. The quality of software in production depends on both the code and the work that makes that code reliable, understandable, and maintainable.

## The Unexpected Gift

People sometimes express mild surprise when they learn that a technology executive is a serious knitter. I find the surprise interesting. The skills involved — precision, patience, systematic problem-solving, the ability to hold complex state in mind — are useful in exactly the domains that technology work requires.

Hobbies that seem unrelated to your professional work often aren't. The perspective shifts, the skill analogies, the cognitive habits built in one context transfer in unexpected ways. The knitter who becomes a developer brings something different to the practice than the developer who doesn't knit.

This is, I think, the strongest argument for pursuing genuinely diverse interests throughout your life and career. Not as stress relief or balance — though they serve those purposes too — but because the cross-domain insights compound in ways that enrich both the professional and personal work.

Pattern recognition is valuable. And patterns are everywhere, if you learn to see them.
