I've watched technology hype cycles from the inside for 30 years. The dot-com boom. The Web 2.0 wave. Social media as a business panacea. Big Data. Blockchain and Web3. And now, the AI wave that's currently cresting.

Each cycle has the same basic structure: a genuine technological capability emerges, its potential is extrapolated beyond what the current state of the technology can deliver, enormous amounts of capital flow toward the extrapolation rather than the current reality, and then a correction occurs that leaves some real value standing while sweeping away the overstatement.

The value is real. The correction is also real. The question for technology leaders is how to engage with genuine technological shifts while maintaining appropriate skepticism about the extrapolations.

Here's what I've learned about that navigation.

## What Hype Cycles Have in Common

Every major technology hype cycle I've observed shares several features.

**A genuine underlying technology.** The dot-com boom was built on the internet, which really did change almost everything. Blockchain solved real distributed consensus problems, even if most blockchain applications turned out not to require those solutions. Generative AI represents genuine capability in language modeling and pattern recognition. The hype is always attached to something real — it's the extrapolation that becomes problematic.

**Extrapolation that outpaces evidence.** In every cycle, the narrative gets ahead of the demonstrated capability. In the dot-com era, the hypothesis that "internet companies don't need profitable business models" was stated seriously and believed widely. In the blockchain era, the idea that decentralized ledgers would replace most financial and contractual intermediaries was mainstream venture capital belief. Current AI narratives include claims about AGI timelines and sweeping transformations of industries that may or may not materialize on the timescales being discussed.

**Capital misallocation at scale.** The extrapolation attracts investment. Enormous amounts of capital flow into use cases that turn out not to work, at valuations that turn out not to be defensible, toward companies that turn out not to create sustainable value. This is economically wasteful, and organizations that participate in it without discipline pay real costs.

**Survivorship bias in the post-hype assessment.** After the correction, the successful applications that did emerge are often used to retroactively justify the scale of the original hype. "See, the internet really did change everything." Yes, but at a fraction of the speed that was projected and at a fraction of the economic value that was claimed. The correction happened, the adjustment of expectations to reality was painful, and the genuine value that emerged could have been invested in more precisely if the hype had been more calibrated.

## Why Smart People Believe the Hype

There are structural reasons why intelligent people — including experienced technology leaders — get pulled into hype cycles.

**The genuine uncertainty problem.** It's genuinely difficult to know in advance which applications of a new technology will succeed. Given that uncertainty, being dismissive carries real risk — you might dismiss what turns out to be transformative. So the rational response for many people is to invest broadly, "just in case."

**Competitive anxiety.** If you believe your competitors are getting ahead by investing in a new technology, the cost of not participating seems higher than the cost of investing unwisely. This is sometimes rational and sometimes a rationalization.

**Social proof cascades.** When enough credible people publicly endorse a technology or approach, skepticism starts to look uninformed. Sophisticated investors, accomplished executives, and recognized experts are all enthusiastic — doesn't that mean something?

It means something, but not as much as it feels like in the moment. History is full of sophisticated people who were wrong in coordinated ways.

**Sunk cost and identity.** Once you've made a significant investment in a technology direction — financially or in terms of your public positioning — it becomes psychologically difficult to update based on new evidence. The belief has become part of your identity.

## A Framework for Evaluation

The framework I've developed for evaluating technology trends starts with a few basic questions.

**Does it solve a problem that currently exists and matters?** Not "could this create new possibilities" — that's almost always true of any significant technology — but: is there a real, identifiable problem that this solves better than existing alternatives, for a specific population that's willing to pay for the solution?

**Is the value proposition clear at current capability levels?** If the technology requires assuming significant future improvements to generate value, that's a warning sign. The applications that survive hype cycles are usually ones that were valuable at the technology's current state of development, not ones that were valuable given where it would eventually get to.

**What's the realistic best case, and does it justify the investment at current valuations?** Hype inflates valuations beyond what even optimistic scenarios can support. Doing the math honestly on "what does success actually look like, and what's it worth if it happens?" often reveals that the investment doesn't make sense even if everything goes right.

**What does historical adoption of similar technologies suggest?** Adoption of transformative technologies tends to be slower than proponents predict. Computing has gotten dramatically more powerful over 30 years; it's still not managed healthcare or replaced most knowledge workers. Some of that is still coming. Most of it is further away than the hype suggests.

**Are you doing this because it's right for your specific context, or because everyone else is?** "We have to have an AI strategy" is not a strategy. "We've identified these three specific use cases where ML can improve our operations, and here's how we'll evaluate whether they're working" is a strategy.

## What I'm Skeptical About and What I'm Not

For transparency: I'm relatively skeptical about Web3/blockchain applications in most enterprise contexts. The problems they solve — decentralized trust without a central intermediary — are genuine but they're not the problems that most enterprises actually face. Most enterprise data and transaction problems are better solved with established distributed systems and governance frameworks. I've watched too many blockchain pilot programs produce impressive demonstrations and no production deployments.

I'm genuinely enthusiastic about AI/ML in operational contexts — with the qualification that I've articulated elsewhere that it requires careful problem definition and realistic expectations. I've seen it work in specific, well-defined applications. The current generation of language models opens new possibilities that are real even if the timelines for their full deployment are longer than the hype suggests.

The distinction I'm drawing is between technologies where I see clear, demonstrated value in current applications versus technologies where the value proposition depends primarily on future improvements or on solving problems that organizations don't actually have.

## The Leader's Responsibility

Technology leaders have a specific responsibility in hype cycles: to serve as the voice of analytical clarity in environments where enthusiasm is commercially incentivized.

Vendors, investors, and consultants have financial interests in your adoption of new technology. That doesn't make them dishonest — they often genuinely believe what they're selling — but it means that their analysis isn't unbiased. Your job is to bring unbiased analysis to the table.

That sometimes means disappointing people who want you to be more enthusiastic. It sometimes means being wrong — the technology you were skeptical of turned out to be more transformative than you thought. That's a recoverable mistake; investing heavily in something that doesn't deliver is often more costly.

The leaders who have served their organizations best through the hype cycles I've witnessed were not the ones who were most enthusiastic or most skeptical. They were the ones who were most honest about what was known and what wasn't, and who made deliberate choices about where to invest based on that honesty.

That's a durable approach to an environment that will continue to produce hype cycles regardless of what we do. The next one is probably already forming.
