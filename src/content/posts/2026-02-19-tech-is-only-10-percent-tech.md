Early in my career, I believed that the key to successful technology delivery was choosing the right technology. Pick the right architecture. Use the right tools. Hire people with the right technical skills. Get the technical decisions right, and the rest would follow.

I was wrong about the weight of that. Not entirely wrong — technical decisions matter. But after 30 years of watching technology projects succeed and fail, I've arrived at a number that feels roughly right: the technology itself accounts for maybe 10% of the outcome.

The other 90% is people and process.

This is not a comfortable thing to say in an industry that celebrates technical complexity. But it's what I've actually observed.

## What I Mean By "Only 10%"

I don't mean that technical decisions are unimportant. Choosing a fundamentally flawed architecture can create problems that are very expensive to unwind. Ignoring security at the design level creates vulnerabilities that are sometimes irreparable. Technical debt accumulates and eventually demands payment.

What I mean is that among all the factors that determine whether a technology initiative succeeds, the technical choices are rarely the deciding ones. I've watched technically sophisticated projects fail because the team couldn't communicate, the leadership couldn't make decisions, the organization couldn't change its processes to take advantage of the new system. I've watched technically modest projects succeed because the team executed with discipline, communicated clearly, and maintained relentless focus on what customers actually needed.

The technology was not the variable. The people and the process were.

## Where Projects Actually Fail

**Unclear problem definition.** A stunning proportion of failed technology projects were solving the wrong problem — either a problem that wasn't the most important one, or a problem that didn't quite match what customers actually needed. No technology solves for a wrong problem definition. This is a human failure: inadequate conversation, inadequate listening, inadequate willingness to challenge initial assumptions.

**Communication breakdown between technical and business stakeholders.** Engineers who can't explain what they're building to the people who need to use it, or business leaders who can't articulate their actual needs to the people building for them — this gap is responsible for an enormous amount of wasted effort. It's not a technical problem. It's a communication and culture problem.

**Change management failures.** Organizations consistently underestimate how hard it is to change how people work. Successful technology implementation requires changing habits, workflows, and sometimes organizational structures. Most technology projects plan for the build and not for the change. The technology is installed; the organization doesn't actually change. Value is never realized.

**Leadership that can't make decisions.** Projects drift when no one can commit to a direction. Technical teams need clear direction to execute well. When leadership is conflict-averse or politically paralyzed, projects go in circles. This has nothing to do with the technology.

**Team dysfunction and psychological safety.** Teams where people can't surface problems, where the culture punishes bad news, where individuals protect their turf rather than collaborate — these teams don't build good things, regardless of their technical ability. The best engineers I've known underperform in bad cultures.

## The Underrated Elements

**Documentation.** Boring, unglamorous, endlessly deferred. Also essential. Systems without adequate documentation are fragile — they depend on institutional knowledge held in the heads of specific people. When those people leave, the knowledge leaves with them. The discipline of writing things down clearly is one of the most leveraged investments a technology organization can make.

**Communication rituals.** Regular, structured communication — not meetings for the sake of meetings, but predictable forums where the right information gets to the right people — dramatically reduces the coordination failures that derail projects. This sounds obvious. It's rarely done well.

**Hiring for character as much as skill.** Technical skills can be learned and developed. Intellectual honesty, willingness to acknowledge mistakes, genuine curiosity, and collaborative instincts are much harder to develop in adults. I've made the mistake of overweighting technical credentials and underweighting character. It reliably produces problems.

**Process that enables rather than constrains.** The word "process" has a bad reputation in technology culture — it evokes bureaucracy, slowdowns, gatekeepers. But the right process is the opposite of that. A good deployment process makes deployments faster and safer. A good code review process improves quality and shares knowledge. The difference between process as bureaucracy and process as enabler is whether the process was designed to serve the people doing the work, or to serve the people managing it.

**Customer proximity.** Technology teams that are close to customers — who talk to them regularly, who see how the product is actually used, who feel the friction customers feel — make better decisions. This sounds obvious, but there's enormous organizational pressure that creates distance between engineers and users. That distance is costly.

## A Story That Illustrates This

At one of my executive roles, I inherited a technology organization that was technically competent by most measures. Good engineers, reasonable tooling, solid architecture decisions. But the uptime was poor, the team was burned out, and the business was losing trust in technology's ability to deliver.

We didn't fix this by changing the technology stack. We fixed it by changing the culture and the process. We implemented disciplined change management — requiring review and approval for risky changes, establishing blackout periods during critical business events, making post-mortems blameless and genuinely learning from them.

Within a year, outage hours had dropped by 97%.

The technology hadn't changed. The engineering talent hadn't changed. The culture of how the team operated — the shared understanding of what careful work looked like — had changed. And that change was what delivered the outcome.

## What This Means for Technology Leaders

If you accept that people and process are the primary levers, the implications are significant.

Your most important hires are not just the most technically sophisticated people — they're the people who can communicate, collaborate, and build trust with non-technical stakeholders. The "brilliant jerk" is a net negative regardless of their technical output.

Your most important investments are in organizational clarity — clear ownership, clear decision rights, clear communication channels. These are less exciting than technology investments but more consequential.

The things that don't feel like "real work" — writing documentation, holding retrospectives, facilitating alignment conversations — are often the highest-leverage activities available to you.

And when something goes wrong, the instinct to look for a technical explanation first is usually wrong. Start with the human and organizational dynamics. The technical issues are often downstream of those.

Technology matters. But the people and process that surround it matter more. That's not a limitation to accept reluctantly. It's actually good news — because culture and process are things you can shape deliberately, which means the outcomes are more within your control than the technology's inherent constraints would suggest.
