I've mentored engineers who became CTOs. I've also mentored engineers who would have been better served by a different approach from me — where I gave advice when they needed space to figure things out, or gave autonomy when they needed more guidance.

Mentorship is not a single skill that you either have or don't have. It's a practice that gets better with reflection and deliberate effort, and it's one that I've had to update my mental model of repeatedly over the course of my career.

Here's what I think I understand now that I didn't when I started.

## What Mentorship Is Not

It's not telling people what you would do. The advice that comes most naturally to experienced leaders — "here's what I did in a similar situation" — is often the least useful. Your situation and your mentee's situation are different in ways that matter. Your instincts were shaped by your specific experiences, which they don't have. What worked for you in 2005 in a large enterprise may not translate to their context in 2026 at a startup.

This doesn't mean your experience is worthless. It means that framing your experience as instruction rather than as one data point among many is usually a mistake.

It's not having an answer for every problem. One of the most valuable things a mentor can do is model comfort with not knowing — demonstrating how to approach ambiguity, how to ask good questions, how to evaluate options without false certainty. Mentees who watch you pretend to know things you don't learn to pretend, not to think.

It's not a transaction. Mentorship is a relationship, and relationships take time. A single conversation can be useful, but the mentees who developed most significantly under my involvement were the ones I engaged with over years, through different challenges and phases of their careers. The accumulated context matters.

## What Actually Helps

**Listening before advising.** The proportion of most mentorship conversations that should be listening is higher than most mentors instinctively practice. Before you can give useful guidance, you need to understand the actual problem — which is often not the problem as first presented. People frequently open with a surface-level question when the real question is different and deeper. Creating space for that real question to emerge requires sustained listening and patience.

**Asking questions that open things up rather than close them down.** "What have you already considered?" and "What's the version of this that works out well?" are more useful than "Here's what you should do." Questions that help someone think more clearly about their own situation are often more valuable than answers.

**Giving increasing responsibility with a safety net.** The best mentorship I've provided has involved giving people real, meaningful work that stretched them beyond their current capabilities — while ensuring that the consequences of struggling were manageable. This is different from throwing people in at the deep end (which is not mentorship) and different from protecting them from any challenge (which is also not mentorship). The tension between support and stretch is where growth actually happens.

**Naming what you observe.** Mentees often lack perspective on their own patterns — the strengths they underestimate, the habits that limit them, the way they're perceived by others. An honest observer who can name these things — with care, not as criticism — provides something that's very hard to get elsewhere. This requires trust in the relationship and skill in delivery, but it's one of the highest-value things a mentor can do.

**Following their agenda, not yours.** The mentorship relationship serves the mentee's development, not the mentor's desire to share wisdom. If you find yourself excited to talk about something because it's interesting to you, check whether it's actually what they need right now. The most useful question at the start of any mentorship conversation is: what do you most want help thinking through?

## What I've Learned From Mentoring

The common wisdom is that mentorship benefits the mentee. What's underappreciated is how much the mentor gets from it.

Being asked to explain why you do something — really explain it, in a way that helps someone else understand — forces a level of clarity about your own reasoning that you don't get from just doing it. I've changed my own practices more than once because a mentee's question revealed that I couldn't actually articulate a good reason for what I was doing.

Junior engineers see things that senior engineers have stopped seeing. The organizational dynamics that experienced leaders have normalized, the friction points that veterans work around automatically, the things that seem strange from outside the culture — mentees surface all of this. If you're listening, it's genuinely useful information.

And there's something that happens over years of mentorship where you realize you're watching someone develop their own leadership identity — not a copy of yours, but something that emerged partly from the conversation and partly from everything else they are. That's a genuinely rewarding thing to witness.

## The Legacy That Outlasts the Work

I've been at this long enough to watch people I mentored early in their careers now mentor others. The ideas, the frameworks, the ways of thinking about problems — they don't disappear when the conversation ends. They propagate forward in ways that neither the mentor nor the mentee fully controls.

This is the real reason to invest in mentorship. Not as a charitable act toward junior people, and not as a way to build loyalty within a specific organization, but because developing the capacity of the people around you is genuinely the highest-leverage work a senior leader can do.

The most valuable professional legacy isn't the technology you built or the company you helped grow. It's the people who are doing better work, in more places, because at some point you showed up consistently and took their development seriously.

That's a return worth investing in.
