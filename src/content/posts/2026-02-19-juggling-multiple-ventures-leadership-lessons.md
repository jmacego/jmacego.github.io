Somewhere around my third or fourth simultaneous leadership role, I stopped trying to explain it at dinner parties and just said I was "semi-retired." It was easier than describing the reality: that I was actively involved in several companies at once, each at a different stage, each in a different domain, all competing for the same finite hours in a day.

This is a piece about what that actually looks like — the unglamorous parts, the genuinely rewarding parts, and what I've learned about leadership by doing it in parallel across very different contexts.

## How This Happens

Nobody plans to run five companies simultaneously. It tends to accumulate. You have one venture, you get involved in another as an advisor, the advisory role deepens, someone asks if you'd consider a board seat, an old colleague brings you in on something interesting. Before long, you have a portfolio of commitments and a calendar that requires serious management.

In my case, it's a combination of fractional CTO engagements, existing business interests, board-level involvement, and a couple of projects I care about personally. The common thread is that each one draws on different parts of my experience — technology strategy, operations, retail, aviation — so they're not quite as fragmented as they might look from the outside.

But they are genuinely simultaneous. Multiple Monday mornings, multiple teams expecting my attention, multiple sets of problems I need to hold in my head.

## What Actually Works

**Strict time blocking, religiously maintained.** Each company gets dedicated time — specific days or half-days where my attention belongs to them completely. When I'm in that block, I'm not checking messages from the other companies, I'm not half-present. I'm genuinely there. This sounds obvious but it requires real discipline, because the temptation to blur context is constant.

**A single capture system.** Every commitment, every open question, every follow-up gets into one system immediately. I've experimented with different tools over the years; what matters isn't which tool but that everything is in one place. The moment something lives in your head instead of a trusted system, you've introduced a failure point.

**Delegation as a forcing function.** Running multiple companies forces you to delegate in ways you might not if you had only one. You simply cannot be the bottleneck across five organizations. This sounds like a constraint, but it's actually one of the most clarifying things you can do — it forces you to identify which decisions actually require your judgment and which ones you're holding onto out of habit or ego.

**Clear written communication.** When you're not always available, clarity matters more. I've gotten much better at written communication — being specific about decisions, rationale, and next steps — because my teams can't always get synchronous time with me when they need it. The discipline of writing things down clearly is good for your own thinking too.

**Knowing which company needs what, right now.** Not every company needs the same kind of attention at the same time. One might be in a steady operational phase where my involvement is light. Another might be in the middle of a critical hiring decision or a technical inflection point that needs more bandwidth. Calibrating intensity across the portfolio is an ongoing exercise.

## What Doesn't Work

**Context-switching mid-task.** Jumping between companies within the same hour is expensive. The cognitive switching cost is real, and you tend to do mediocre work on both rather than excellent work on either. The time blocks exist to prevent this.

**Trying to maintain the same management style across all companies.** A 50-person company with an established engineering team needs different things from me than a 5-person startup still finding product-market fit. I've learned to shift registers deliberately — and to not assume that what works in one context will transfer directly.

**Underestimating the emotional weight.** When things go wrong — and they will — it's harder when you're carrying multiple companies. There's less emotional slack. I've had quarters where two companies were simultaneously in difficult periods, and the accumulated stress was genuinely significant. You have to manage that actively, not just push through.

## What I've Learned About Leadership From This

Running multiple companies in parallel accelerates certain kinds of learning. You see the same problem pattern play out across different organizations and start to recognize what's universal versus what's context-specific. You develop stronger judgment about what actually moves the needle because you don't have the luxury of spending energy on things that don't matter.

You also get better at reading organizational health quickly. When you're coming into a company context cold every week, you get good at picking up signals — how people communicate, what's not being said in a meeting, whether the team has genuine confidence or is papering over problems. That diagnostic sense is valuable.

And you develop a healthier relationship with not knowing everything. In a single company, a leader can sometimes maintain the illusion of having a hand in everything. Across multiple companies, you can't. You have to trust your people more, which — if you've built the right teams — turns out to be a feature, not a bug.

## Is This For Everyone?

No. Candidly, this approach requires a specific disposition. You have to be comfortable with ambiguity, with imperfect information, with the fact that something will always be going less well than you'd like. You have to have enough self-awareness to know when you're stretched too thin — because no one else is going to tell you.

You also have to have built enough of a track record that companies are willing to engage with you in this way. Trust is the foundation. Nobody brings in a fractional leader they don't believe will actually show up, mentally and practically, for their specific needs.

But for those for whom it fits, running multiple ventures simultaneously is one of the more genuinely interesting ways to spend a career chapter. The variety is energizing. The cross-pollination of ideas is real. And the accumulated perspective you develop — from seeing many different organizational challenges in a compressed period — compounds in ways that I'm still discovering.
