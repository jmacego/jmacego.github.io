I started in technology before the World Wide Web was accessible to most people. I've watched the industry cycle through mainframes to PCs to the internet to mobile to cloud to AI, each wave declared the most transformative thing to ever happen — and each one genuinely transformative in its own way.

After more than 30 years, I have a perspective that isn't available from inside any single era. I've been present for enough of the changes to have opinions about which ones actually mattered and which ones were mostly noise. More importantly, I've watched the same human dynamics play out across every cycle, under every new technology, in every market condition.

Here's what I've seen change, what hasn't, and what that means for people leading technology organizations today.

## What Has Actually Changed

**The speed of capability diffusion.** In the early 1990s, a significant technological capability might take a decade to become widely adopted. The infrastructure, the skills, the tooling, the organizational change management — all of it moved slowly. Today, a new AI model goes from research paper to widespread enterprise experimentation in months. The window between "early adopters playing with this" and "everyone has access to this" has compressed dramatically.

This has real implications for competitive strategy. The first-mover advantage window is shorter. The technology moats that used to last years now last months. Leadership has to move faster and be more comfortable with incomplete information than previous generations of technology executives.

**The talent landscape.** In the 1990s, software developers were a relatively rare breed. "Computer science degree from a good school" was a strong filter, and the supply-demand imbalance meant that companies competed intensely for a narrow pool of candidates. Today, the paths into technology are radically more diverse — bootcamps, self-taught developers, international talent, open-source contribution histories. Assessment has to be more sophisticated because credentials are less predictive.

**Infrastructure expectations.** I ran data centers. Physical servers, power circuits, raised floors, generator contracts, cooling calculations. I watched the cloud shift eliminate most of that as a day-to-day operational concern for most organizations. The skills required to run infrastructure have changed fundamentally, and a lot of what constituted hard-won expertise in the 1990s and 2000s is simply no longer relevant.

**The business-technology integration.** When I started my career, technology was largely a back-office concern. IT departments were cost centers that kept the lights on. The notion that technology was a strategic differentiator was an emerging idea, not an established fact. Today, in most industries, technology strategy and business strategy are inseparable. The CTO or CIO is at the strategy table, not just the budget meeting.

**Remote and distributed work.** I spent years managing teams that were all in the same building, then the same campus, then the same time zone. The last decade forced organizations to develop competence at distributed collaboration that most of them hadn't needed before. Some of those capabilities are genuinely valuable and will persist.

## What Hasn't Changed

**The fundamental importance of trust.** Every technology organization I've led or advised runs on trust — trust between leadership and teams, trust between technical staff and business stakeholders, trust between the company and its customers. The form that trust-building takes has evolved, but the underlying requirement hasn't. Technology doesn't change the fact that people do their best work in environments where they feel psychologically safe.

**The gap between what technology can do and what organizations can absorb.** In every decade, the technology has been ahead of the organizational and human capacity to use it well. In the 1990s, companies were installing ERP systems that could transform their operations and managing those deployments badly. Today, companies are implementing AI tools in ways that don't account for the human workflow changes required to make them effective. The pattern repeats because it's fundamentally about organizational change, not technology capability.

**The value of clear communication.** I've worked with brilliant technologists who couldn't explain what they were doing to anyone outside their immediate team, and I've watched that limitation cost them and their organizations significantly. The ability to translate technical complexity into clear, business-relevant language has been valuable for 30 years and shows no signs of becoming less so.

**Customer-centricity as a differentiator.** The organizations that focus relentlessly on what customers actually need — not what the technology can do, not what's interesting to engineers, but what solves a real problem for a real person — outperform over time. This was true in 1995, it was true in 2005, it was true in 2015, and it's true now. The companies that forget this in favor of chasing technological capability for its own sake reliably underperform.

**The importance of saying no.** Leaders who can't say no to new technology initiatives, new features, new directions — because they don't want the conflict, or because everything sounds exciting, or because they haven't developed the judgment to distinguish what matters from what doesn't — create organizational chaos. The best technology leaders I've known have been selective in ways that sometimes looked like stubbornness in the moment but proved wise in retrospect.

## What This Means for Leaders Today

If I were advising a technology leader who was 15 years into their career and wondering what the next 15 looked like, I'd say this:

The technology will keep changing. Whatever you've mastered will be partially obsolete. You need to accept that and build the skills of continuous learning rather than the comfort of expertise in a specific stack or platform.

But the human and organizational skills compound differently. Leadership, communication, judgment, trust-building — these get better with time and experience in ways that technical skills don't necessarily. The investment in those capabilities has a longer half-life.

And the fundamentals matter. Across every technological era I've watched, the organizations that focused on clear problem definition, genuine customer value, sustainable growth, and strong team culture outperformed the ones chasing whatever was new and exciting. That's probably the most boring insight I have after 30 years in technology. It's also probably the most reliable.
