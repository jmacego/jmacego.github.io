In 30 years in technology, I've been involved in web hosting before most people knew what the internet was, aviation technology, specialty retail systems, enterprise IT at scale, machine learning for network operations, and now AI-augmented consulting. The common thread across all of it — the thing that made each transition possible and each chapter productive — has been a consistent commitment to learning as a practice, not as an event.

This piece is about what that practice actually looks like, what's sustained it over time, and what I think matters most about maintaining curiosity in a field that changes as fast as ours does.

## The Half-Life of Technical Knowledge

Technical knowledge depreciates faster than most people intuitively account for. The specific skills that made a developer highly employable in 2010 — in terms of specific languages, frameworks, and architectural patterns — are different from what makes someone highly employable today. Most of that change happened gradually, but it's cumulatively dramatic.

This is not a crisis for people who learn continuously. It's a significant problem for people who don't.

The engineers I've watched struggle most through major technology transitions are the ones who established expertise in a specific stack and then stopped learning substantially. They weren't negligent; they were busy doing their jobs. But the environment moved, and their skills didn't, and at some point the gap became visible.

The engineers who've navigated multiple technology eras successfully are, consistently, the ones who maintained a learning practice throughout. Not just learning new frameworks within a familiar paradigm, but genuine engagement with new ideas, new approaches, and sometimes entirely different ways of thinking about problems.

## What a Learning Practice Actually Looks Like

"Stay current" and "keep learning" are easy to say and hard to operationalize. Here's what has actually worked for me.

**Reading with intent, not just quantity.** I read a lot, but not everything. I've developed a filter over time: is this deepening my understanding of something I care about, or am I just consuming because consuming feels like learning? The latter is easy to confuse with the former and much less productive. A few deeply read books or papers in a year produce more enduring knowledge than dozens of articles skimmed.

**Adjacent domains as sources of insight.** Some of my most useful professional thinking has come from reading outside technology entirely — books on decision-making, organizational behavior, complex systems, and history. The patterns in how human organizations succeed and fail are surprisingly consistent across domains and time periods. The literature on organizational behavior and systems thinking, for instance, has shaped how I think about technology organizations far more than most explicitly technology-focused material.

**Learning by building, not just reading.** Reading about a technology gives you theoretical familiarity. Building something with it gives you experiential knowledge that's much richer — including an understanding of where the rough edges are, what the learning curve actually looks like, and what problems emerge in practice that the documentation doesn't mention. I've built things with technologies I had no professional need for, specifically to understand them from the inside.

**Community engagement where practitioners are candid.** The places where practitioners talk honestly — technical conferences, good online communities, high-quality blogs by working engineers — are often more informative than polished vendor content or mainstream technology journalism. The person working through a real implementation challenge and writing about what they're learning is a better source than a press release about how transformative something is.

**Formally structured learning when the depth requires it.** For topics where I needed serious depth — machine learning, for instance — I've gone back to structured coursework: textbooks, online courses with real assessments, working through foundational materials rather than just reading summaries. The ML work that led to a patent required that kind of depth, and self-directed reading wouldn't have produced it.

## The Role of Diverse Interests

One of the underappreciated aspects of continuous learning is that the best cross-domain insights come from genuine engagement with the other domain, not superficial familiarity.

My background in aviation shaped how I think about operational safety culture in ways that reading about safety culture abstractly would not have. My practice in photography shaped how I think about perspective-taking in problem-solving in ways that wouldn't have happened through a leadership course. My experience in retail gave me a customer-proximity perspective that I couldn't have acquired through user research frameworks alone.

These aren't metaphors I'm reaching for after the fact. They're actual thinking tools that emerged from genuine immersion in different domains and that operate continuously in how I approach technology leadership problems.

The argument for diverse interests is not that they make you interesting at dinner parties (though they do). It's that genuine depth in domains outside your primary field produces a different kind of thinking — one that recognizes patterns across domains and generates insights that specialists in a single field are less likely to reach.

The research on this is consistent: people who develop expertise across multiple domains are, under the right conditions, better at certain kinds of innovation than deep specialists. The right conditions include developing genuine depth in at least a few domains, not just casual familiarity with many.

## Avoiding Burnout in a Fast-Moving Field

One genuine risk in a commitment to continuous learning is burnout. Technology moves fast enough that trying to keep up with everything is exhausting and, ultimately, impossible. Many people I know experience a version of this: a low-grade anxiety that they're behind, that something important is happening that they don't know about, that the field is moving too fast to stay current.

The reframe that's helped me: you don't need to know everything. You need to know enough to make good decisions in your current context, to have productive conversations with the people you work with, and to recognize when something important is happening that you need to dig into.

That's a much more manageable goal, and it's actually what's required. The CTO who is anxiously trying to be current on every technology development is probably not spending enough time on the human and organizational dimensions that actually drive outcomes. The CTO who has given up on technical currency entirely is a different problem. The right calibration is selective depth: genuine engagement with areas that are relevant to your current decisions, and enough broad awareness to recognize when something outside your current focus is becoming relevant.

I've also found that the anxiety about keeping up decreases significantly when you have a stable practice and trust that the practice will surface what's important. If you read thoughtfully, build regularly, and stay engaged with good communities, the things that matter will tend to reach you. Perfect coverage is impossible; good coverage through consistent practice is very achievable.

## What Curiosity Protects You Against

In the long run, I think curiosity is as important as the specific knowledge it produces.

Leaders who are genuinely curious ask better questions, hold their conclusions more lightly, and update their mental models more readily when evidence contradicts them. They're more interesting to the people who work with them, because they're engaging with the world rather than just executing on established beliefs.

Leaders who have lost their curiosity — who have settled into their existing frameworks and stopped finding new things genuinely interesting — tend to make worse decisions over time, not because they become less intelligent but because their models stop updating while the world keeps changing.

Curiosity is, in this sense, a form of epistemic hygiene. It keeps you from the comfortable but expensive mistake of assuming that what you already know is sufficient for the decisions you'll face next.

After 30 years, I'm still finding things genuinely interesting. Technologies I haven't worked with. Problems I haven't thought through before. Questions I don't know the answers to. That continued sense of genuine interest in the work — in the ideas, not just in the professional outcomes — is something I'd protect before almost anything else in a career.

It's the thing that keeps the work worth doing, and the thing that keeps doing the work from making you worse at it over time.
