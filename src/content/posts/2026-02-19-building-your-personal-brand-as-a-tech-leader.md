For most of my career, I didn't think about "personal brand." I thought about doing good work, building good relationships, and developing capabilities that would be useful to organizations I cared about. That was sufficient for a long time.

When I transitioned to fractional CTO and consulting work, I had to reckon with a different reality: the people and organizations I wanted to work with often had no way to discover me or evaluate my credibility before a direct introduction. The work I'd done, the problems I'd solved, the perspectives I'd developed — none of it was visible unless someone happened to know someone who knew me.

Building a public presence changed that. And in doing it, I learned several things about why it's worth doing, how to do it without feeling performative, and what actually works.

## Why This Matters for Senior Tech Leaders Specifically

Junior engineers don't need strong personal brands. Their work speaks for itself within the organizations they work in, and their career advancement comes primarily through internal recognition and direct referrals within professional networks.

Senior leaders — and especially those who are considering consulting, fractional work, board roles, or executive positions outside their current organization — operate differently. The opportunities available to them often depend on how visible they are and how easily their value can be assessed by people who don't know them directly.

A well-developed public presence serves several functions:

**Discoverability.** People looking for expertise in your domain can find you and evaluate whether you're a fit before reaching out. This is far more efficient than relying entirely on warm introductions.

**Credibility signaling.** Content that demonstrates your thinking on relevant problems gives prospective clients, partners, or employers a much richer view of your capabilities than a resume. A thoughtful post about how you approached a hard organizational problem says more than a bullet point claiming "strategic leadership."

**Thought development.** Writing publicly forces clarity of thought in ways that internal thinking often doesn't. When you have to explain something to an external audience — without the context shortcuts that internal familiarity provides — you often discover that your understanding of it is less precise than you thought. The discipline is valuable.

**Community building.** Consistent public engagement brings people to you who share your interests and perspectives. That network has value far beyond any individual transaction.

## The Authenticity Problem — and How to Solve It

The main objection I hear from senior tech leaders who haven't built a public presence is some version of: "I don't want to be self-promotional." This is understandable. Much of what passes for personal branding is, in fact, thin self-promotion dressed up as insight.

The answer isn't to avoid building a public presence. It's to be genuinely helpful rather than performing helpfulness.

The content that has served me best is content that I would have wanted to read earlier in my career — things I learned the hard way, frameworks I developed through experience, perspectives on problems I see recurrently. The test I apply: if someone read this, would they come away with something useful that they didn't have before? If yes, the content is worth creating. If the answer is "they'd know more about how impressive I am," I've written the wrong thing.

This sounds obvious. It's also genuinely the distinction that separates content that builds real credibility from content that produces LinkedIn engagement but not actual value.

## What to Actually Write About

If you have more than a decade of technology leadership experience, you have more material than you can probably publish. The challenge isn't finding things to say — it's deciding which things are worth writing up.

I find it useful to start with specific, concrete experiences rather than general principles. "Here's a general principle about change management" is less interesting than "here's a specific situation where our change management process failed and what we learned from it." The general principle can come at the end, but the specific experience is what makes it credible and memorable.

Topics that tend to resonate:

- Specific decisions that went wrong and what the failure revealed
- Frameworks you've actually used, with concrete examples of applying them
- Cross-domain analogies that illuminate technology problems from unexpected angles
- Honest assessments of industry trends with explicit acknowledgment of uncertainty
- Career transitions and what you actually learned from them (not the sanitized version)

The specificity and honesty are the differentiators. Generic thought leadership is abundant and undifferentiated. Content that reflects genuine experience and is honest about complexity is much rarer and more valuable.

## The Consistency Requirement

One post every six months doesn't build a public presence. Consistency matters, and it matters in ways that aren't entirely about the algorithm (though the algorithm is real and does reward consistency).

Consistency matters because it demonstrates that this is an ongoing commitment rather than a moment of enthusiasm. People will follow and engage with someone who reliably produces useful content. They won't maintain attention for someone who posts occasionally when the mood strikes.

What works for maintaining consistency:

**Tie writing to your existing thinking.** If you're working through a hard problem, write about it as you work through it — or after you've worked through it. If you read something that sparks a reaction, write the reaction down. This keeps writing connected to real thinking rather than treating it as an additional obligation separate from your actual work.

**Lower the bar for individual pieces.** Not everything needs to be a fully developed 1500-word essay. A clear observation, a specific question worth thinking about, a reaction to something you read — these are legitimate content that maintains presence without requiring the full production cycle.

**Batch when you're in the flow.** There are periods when writing comes easily and periods when it doesn't. When you're in a writing period, produce more than you need and stockpile for the periods when you're not.

## Your Distinctive Angle

The most effective personal brand isn't built by writing about what everyone else in your field writes about. It's built by bringing something to the conversation that isn't already abundant.

I write from the intersection of technology leadership and unexpected domains — aviation, photography, knitting, retail, medicine — because that's genuinely who I am and because those cross-domain perspectives produce insights that pure technology writing doesn't. That's not a calculated positioning strategy; it's just writing about what I actually know and care about.

What's your intersection? What makes your perspective on technology leadership different from someone who has only ever done technology? That's the territory worth developing.

The leaders who build the most durable public presences are the ones who are writing from a genuinely specific vantage point — not "I'm a tech leader" but "I'm a tech leader who also flew planes, built a retail business, and spent 30 years watching the same organizational patterns repeat across different industries." The specificity makes the perspective distinctive. The distinctiveness is what makes it worth reading.

## Starting

If you've read this and are considering building more of a public presence, the only advice that actually moves things forward is to start writing before you feel ready.

The first few pieces won't be your best. The clarity improves with practice, the voice develops over time, the topics get sharper as you discover what resonates and what doesn't. The gap between the first piece and the tenth piece is always larger than people expect.

But you can't write the tenth piece without writing the first one. Start with something small, something specific, something you know well. Write it down, edit it once, and put it out. See what happens. Adjust from there.

The alternative — continuing to do excellent work that nobody outside your immediate professional network can discover — is increasingly costly for leaders who want to shape their own career trajectories rather than depend entirely on existing relationships. Your experience deserves a wider audience than the people who already know you.
