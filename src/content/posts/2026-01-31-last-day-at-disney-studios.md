Today was my last day at Disney Studios.

It is hard to summarize a chapter like this in a few paragraphs, but meaningful is the word that keeps coming back. I had the privilege of working with people who care deeply about craft, scale, and getting difficult things right.

<!--more-->

Over the years, I had the chance to contribute to work that mattered, learn from colleagues who set a very high bar, and be part of teams that balanced creativity with real-world responsibility. That combination leaves a mark.

What I will carry forward most is the mindset: stay curious, think long-term, and build with people, not around them. Those principles shaped how I think about technology, leadership, and teams, and they will continue to shape what comes next.

To everyone I worked with directly or indirectly, thank you. Thank you for the trust, the conversations, the hard problem-solving, and the shared wins. I am proud of what we built, and grateful for the people I got to build it with.

Now starts the next chapter: semi-retirement, world travel, and a slower pace with no shortage of interesting work.

Over the coming months, I will share a connected series of posts across a few platforms, take on a focused semi-retirement role, and start pulling a new creative writing web application product into the light. Somewhere in that mix, a long-running fiction project will finally get its turn.

There is more complexity behind each of those lines than fits in one post, and that is part of what I'm looking forward to having time to give to each project. If this chapter was about building at scale inside one world-class organization, the next one is about building thoughtfully across several very different worlds.
