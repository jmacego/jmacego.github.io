I get asked to explain networking concepts on a fairly regular basis. In-person, on slack, by e-mail, on LinkedIn, etc. I'm (almost) always happy to answer them, usually by drawing on any available surface.

That, though, is not the best way to let as many people as possible learn from my experience (read: mistakess) so I thought that this might be a better forum.

Have a question you want answered here? Hit me up on [LinkedIn ](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6552675122338238464)
