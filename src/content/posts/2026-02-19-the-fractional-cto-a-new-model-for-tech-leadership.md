After more than 30 years in technology — running startups, leading enterprise IT, and everything in between — I recently made a transition that surprised even me: I became a fractional CTO. Not because I couldn't find a full-time role, but because this model simply makes more sense for where I am and, increasingly, for the companies that need me.

Let me explain what that means, why it's growing, and what I've learned in the early stages of this new chapter.

## What Is a Fractional CTO?

A fractional CTO is a senior technology executive who provides strategic guidance on a part-time or contract basis — typically serving multiple companies simultaneously. Think of it as having a seasoned CTO without the full-time price tag or the organizational overhead that comes with a permanent hire.

The arrangement varies. Some fractional CTOs work 10 hours a week with a company for six months to establish a technology roadmap. Others embed more deeply during a critical phase — a fundraising round, a platform migration, a product launch — then step back once the crisis or opportunity has passed. The engagement is scoped to what the company actually needs.

## Why Companies Are Choosing This Model

The honest reason most early-stage and mid-market companies bring on a fractional CTO is cost. A full-time CTO with genuine depth commands a significant salary, equity, benefits, and organizational bandwidth. Many companies — particularly those between Series A and their first profitable year — simply don't need (or can't afford) that full commitment.

But cost is only part of the story. A fractional CTO often brings *broader* experience than a full-time hire at the same budget level. When you've worked across multiple industries, multiple company sizes, and multiple technology eras, you've seen more failure modes. You've made more mistakes — and learned from them. That pattern recognition has real value.

There's also a pace argument. Fractional leaders are inherently outcome-focused. We don't build empires. We come in, get oriented quickly, identify the highest-leverage interventions, and execute. That discipline is often exactly what a growing company needs from its technology leadership.

## What I Actually Do

Day to day, my work looks like a blend of:

**Strategy and Roadmapping** — Helping leadership teams understand where their technology needs to go over the next 12–24 months, and what it will take to get there. This includes honest conversations about technical debt, build-vs-buy decisions, and how technology investments map to business outcomes.

**Team Assessment and Development** — Evaluating existing engineering talent, identifying gaps, and helping organizations hire or develop toward their actual needs. Sometimes this means coaching a VP of Engineering who has the right instincts but needs a thought partner. Sometimes it means helping define what a first engineering hire should look like.

**Vendor and Architecture Decisions** — Providing an independent perspective on major technology choices. Companies often benefit from having someone in the room who has no political stake in the outcome and has seen these decisions play out before.

**Crisis and Transition Management** — Stabilizing technology operations during a leadership gap, a security incident, or a major platform problem. Having someone who can step into ambiguity and create order quickly is a distinct skill.

**Investor and Board Communication** — Translating technology strategy and risk into language that investors and board members can evaluate. This is increasingly important as technical due diligence becomes more rigorous.

## The Transition From Full-Time Leadership

Going from a full-time executive role — where you have direct reports, a defined budget, and the ability to make things happen through authority — to a fractional role requires a real shift in how you operate.

You have less time with each company, which means you need to get oriented faster and be more deliberate about where you focus. You're working through influence rather than authority, which requires better communication and a higher tolerance for ambiguity. And you're constantly context-switching between different companies, different industries, different cultures.

I'll write more about this transition in a separate piece. But the short version is: the skills that made me effective as a full-time CTO translate, but they have to be applied differently.

## Who This Model Works For

A fractional CTO engagement tends to work best when:

- The company is too early for a full-time CTO hire but past the point where the founding team can handle technology strategy alone
- There's a specific problem or phase the company needs help navigating (fundraising, scaling, a pivot)
- The existing technology leader needs a more experienced thought partner without feeling threatened by a full executive hire
- The company wants access to broad expertise without locking into a single person's worldview full-time

It works less well when a company needs deep, continuous hands-on technical leadership across a large team. At some point, distributed attention becomes a limitation, and the right move is a full-time hire.

## The View From Here

I'm a few months into this chapter, and what I can say is that the variety is energizing. The problems are real, the stakes matter to the people I work with, and I'm drawing on genuinely different parts of my experience depending on the week.

There's something clarifying about working at this level. You get to focus on the problems that actually matter and skip the organizational friction that consumes so much executive bandwidth. That's not universally true — political dynamics exist everywhere — but the ratio is better.

If you're a senior technology leader wondering whether the fractional path makes sense for you, or a company leader wondering whether a fractional CTO could fill a gap, I'm happy to talk through it. The model isn't right for everyone or every situation, but for the right match, it works remarkably well.
