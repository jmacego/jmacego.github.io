Before I returned to technology leadership full-time, I built and ran a specialty retail business — Sheep's Clothing — from the ground up. We sold specialty fiber, yarn, and knitting supplies to an enthusiastic and discerning customer base. We did it well enough to build something successful and eventually exit.

I went into retail knowing it would be a learning experience. I did not fully anticipate what I would learn or how durable those lessons would be.

The thing retail teaches you, irreversibly, is what it feels like to be a customer. Not in the abstract, theoretical way you think about customers when you're designing software from behind a monitor. In the immediate, concrete, interpersonal way — where you are looking a real person in the eye when they can't find what they need, or don't understand how something works, or had an experience that let them down.

That education has shaped how I think about technology products ever since.

## What Changes When Feedback Is Immediate

In technology, the feedback loop between what you build and what customers experience is usually long and filtered. A user encounters a problem in your software. Maybe they search for a solution. Maybe they contact support. Support writes a ticket. The ticket eventually reaches a product manager. The product manager decides whether it's worth addressing. The engineering team eventually addresses it. By the time you understand the problem, it's been through multiple layers of interpretation.

In retail, the feedback is immediate and unfiltered. A customer who is confused by your store layout looks confused, right there, while you're watching. A customer who can't find what they need asks you directly. A customer who had a bad experience tells you, face to face, exactly what happened and how it made them feel.

This directness is uncomfortable and invaluable. You don't have the luxury of rationalization that distance creates. You can't tell yourself that the confusion was user error when the user is standing in front of you looking genuinely lost. You have to actually look at what's happening.

The intensity of that feedback made me a better observer of customer experience in all contexts — including technology. I became much less comfortable with the interpretive distance that technology leaders typically maintain between themselves and the people using what they build.

## Observing Behavior vs. Listening to Statements

One of the most practically important things retail teaches is the difference between what customers say they want and what their behavior reveals they need.

In our store, customers would sometimes ask for things they didn't actually find useful when we provided them. They'd express interest in a product category that, when we expanded, they didn't buy. Conversely, they would reliably gravitate toward arrangements, products, and experiences that they didn't ask for in advance — that emerged from observing how they moved through the store and what they lingered over.

The canonical example from retail is the grocery store: customers say they want the fresh produce near the entrance because it signals freshness and quality, but they also fill their cart with it before they've completed their shopping — which means everything else stacks on top of produce and the items get damaged. The solution (which most modern grocery stores use) is fresh produce early but not at the very entrance. This solution wasn't discoverable from asking customers — it required observing their actual behavior and understanding the underlying needs.

Technology product development has the same structure. Users ask for features that, when built, they don't use — because what they were expressing was a symptom (I can't do X) rather than the root need (I need outcome Y). The developers who understand the difference build the right thing. The ones who take feature requests literally build what was asked for and then wonder why adoption is low.

Retail made me much better at watching how people actually interact with things, as opposed to how they say they interact or expect to interact.

## The Complaining Customer Is Valuable

In retail, you quickly learn to appreciate the customer who complains. Not because the complaint is pleasant, but because the complaint is information that most customers don't bother to provide. Research consistently shows that for every customer who complains, there are many more who had the same experience and didn't say anything — they just didn't come back.

The complaining customer is, paradoxically, more engaged and more invested in your business than the customer who silently leaves. They're giving you the opportunity to understand and fix a problem. That's worth something, even when the delivery of the complaint is difficult.

Technology teams that have built cultures where user feedback — including negative feedback — is genuinely welcomed and genuinely acted upon are building a competitive advantage. The instinct to defend the product, to explain why the user is wrong about their experience, to minimize complaints as unrepresentative — this instinct is costly.

In retail, you develop a practical immunity to this defensiveness, because you can't maintain it face-to-face. The software equivalent is creating direct channels where real users can tell you what's actually happening with genuine attention on the other end.

## Getting Out of the Building

The most famous articulation of this lesson in the startup world is Steve Blank's "get out of the building" — the idea that the most important thing founders can do is talk to actual customers in their natural environment rather than building in isolation based on assumptions.

Retail is a structural version of getting out of the building. You can't avoid customer contact. The market is in the room with you every day.

Technology leaders who don't have that structural forcing mechanism have to create it deliberately. Visit customers. Watch people use your software in their actual environment. Talk to support teams about what they hear every day. Sit in on sales calls where prospects object to your product's limitations. Do the work of making the customer's reality visible to yourself.

The leaders who do this regularly make different decisions than the ones who don't. Not necessarily better decisions in every individual case, but better decisions in aggregate — because their mental model of what they're building for is more accurate.

## The Empathy Dividend

The bottom line from retail is this: direct, unmediated contact with the people you're serving changes how you think about serving them. The technical sophistication, the architectural elegance, the developer-experience quality — all of it eventually serves someone trying to accomplish something in their actual life. When you've felt what it's like to be that person, unable to find what they need, confused by something that seems obvious from the inside, delighted by something they didn't know to ask for — you build differently.

Empathy isn't a soft skill that nice companies invest in while serious companies focus on execution. It's a source of accurate information about what you're actually building, for whom, and whether it's working. Organizations that have it make better products. Organizations that don't make products for themselves.

I'm grateful for the years I spent in retail, including the difficult ones. They gave me something that no amount of technical education could have provided.
