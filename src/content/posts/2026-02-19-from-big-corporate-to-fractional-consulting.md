When I left my corporate executive role and started working as a fractional CTO for startups and growth-stage companies, I made an assumption that turned out to be wrong. I assumed that after more than three decades in technology — including significant time in large enterprise environments — I would adapt quickly. I had the experience. I had the credentials. I had the scars.

What I underestimated was how much of my effectiveness in large organizations depended on things that simply don't exist in smaller ones. Authority. Budget. Headcount. Organizational momentum. A known brand that opened doors. In corporate, you can get things done through a combination of positional power and institutional weight. In consulting, you have neither.

Here's what I had to actually change.

## What Changes

**Authority becomes influence.** In a corporate CTO role, I could make a decision and expect it to be implemented. I had direct reports who would execute. I had budget authority. I had organizational credibility built over years.

In fractional work, you have none of that. You're an outsider — a trusted one, you hope, but still an outsider. Decisions happen through people who don't report to you, in cultures you're still learning, with history you weren't part of. Everything is influence, which means everything is communication, relationship, and trust-building. That shift is harder than it sounds for people who've operated through authority for years.

**Speed of orientation.** In a full-time role, you have the luxury of time. The first 90 days can be spent listening, learning, building relationships. You might not make big moves until month four or five, and nobody thinks less of you for it.

Fractional engagements don't work that way. You're brought in because something needs to happen — usually soon. You need to orient faster, form judgments faster, and be willing to act on incomplete information. The standard for "good enough to proceed" is different.

**Assumptions about context.** In large enterprises, you can assume a certain level of infrastructure: established HR processes, legal teams, finance functions, procurement frameworks. Many of these exist because they need to. When I moved into startup consulting, I had to recalibrate my baseline assumptions constantly. Some startups have almost none of this, and that's actually appropriate for their stage. Bringing in enterprise-style process before it's warranted is one of the most common ways consultants create friction rather than value.

**The emotional contract.** In corporate, the organization has a structure for handling ambiguity. There are processes, committees, escalation paths. In advisory work, the ambiguity often lands directly on you. Founders are scared, teams are uncertain, the stakes feel personal in a way they sometimes don't in large organizations. The emotional register is different, and you need to be present to it in a different way.

## What Transfers

Some things transfer remarkably well.

**Pattern recognition.** Having seen a lot of technology organizations succeed and fail, you develop an instinct for what's working and what isn't. This is genuinely valuable in any context, and it's something early-career leaders simply can't replicate regardless of their technical skills.

**Stakeholder communication.** Years of presenting to boards, briefing executives, and translating technical complexity into business language is a durable skill. Early-stage companies often desperately need someone who can help them communicate with investors and boards in language those audiences actually respond to.

**Knowing what you don't know.** Counterintuitively, one of the most valuable things you develop after decades in technology is a clear sense of your own limitations. You've been wrong enough times that you've built calibration. That epistemic humility is rare and valuable in any advisory relationship.

**The network.** Thirty years of relationships with engineers, executives, investors, and vendors creates a network that can be genuinely useful to early-stage companies. A warm introduction from someone who knows the landscape is worth real money in time saved.

## Practical Advice for Making the Transition

**Start before you're ready.** If you're waiting until you feel fully prepared for the shift from corporate to consulting, you'll wait indefinitely. The learning happens by doing.

**Take a few lower-stakes engagements first.** If you can, start with companies where the consequences of getting the transition wrong are manageable — for them and for you. Use those early engagements to calibrate your assumptions about what works in this new context.

**Find a community of other fractional leaders.** The challenges are similar enough that others who've made this transition have useful things to say. Fractional leadership communities have grown significantly in recent years and the peer learning is genuine.

**Be honest about what you're still figuring out.** The fastest way to destroy trust in a consulting relationship is to project more certainty than you have. Clients can tell when you're on solid ground versus when you're improvising, and they'll respect you more for naming the difference.

**Rebuild patience with yourself.** You're going to be less effective initially than you were at your corporate peak. That's not failure; it's the normal shape of a transition. The executives I've watched struggle most with this shift are the ones who interpret the discomfort of early-stage consulting as a sign they've made a mistake, rather than a temporary state of building new competence.

## The Long View

A few months into my fractional work, the skills I built in corporate contexts are showing up in unexpected ways — and the gaps I had to fill are making me a more complete leader. The adaptation is real, but it's also clarifying. You find out, pretty quickly, which of your capabilities are genuinely yours and which were on loan from the institution.

For experienced technology leaders considering this path: the transition is hard, worthwhile, and probably not as permanent a shift as it initially feels. The core of what made you effective travels with you. The packaging just has to change.
