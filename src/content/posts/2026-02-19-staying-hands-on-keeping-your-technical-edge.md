There's a conventional career arc in technology: engineer, then tech lead, then engineering manager, then director, then VP or CTO. Each step is supposed to involve moving further from the technical work and closer to people management, strategy, and organizational influence.

The implicit message of this arc is that hands-on technical work is what you leave behind on the way up. That staying technical past a certain level of seniority is either unprofessional (you should be focused on strategy, not code) or a signal of failure to fully develop as a leader.

I think this model is wrong, or at least incomplete. Maintaining genuine technical engagement — not as a primary job function but as a deliberate practice — has made me a better leader across every role I've held. Here's why I think that's true and what "staying hands-on" actually looks like at the executive level.

## Why Technical Currency Matters in Leadership

**Credibility with engineering teams.** The teams I've led have consistently responded differently to leaders who understood what they were doing versus leaders who didn't. Not because they wanted their CTO writing production code — they didn't — but because they could tell when I was making technically informed decisions versus when I was just managing a process. That difference in credibility affects everything: the quality of conversations, the willingness to surface problems, the trust that comes from believing their leader understands the implications of what they're being asked to do.

**Better decisions about technology investments.** An executive who is genuinely familiar with the current state of technology — who has played with the new tools, who understands the architectural trade-offs, who can assess a vendor's claims with some technical foundation — makes better resource allocation decisions than one who is entirely dependent on technical staff to translate. That dependency isn't inherently bad, but it's a single point of failure in the advisory chain.

**More useful participation in architecture conversations.** I don't need to be the one designing the architecture of production systems. But I need to be able to participate meaningfully in conversations about it — to ask useful questions, to recognize when something sounds off, to contribute to the assessment of trade-offs. Maintaining technical currency keeps me a participant rather than a passive recipient of others' recommendations.

**Personal grounding.** There is something that I can only describe as grounding about actually building things — writing code, tinkering with hardware, working through a technical problem from first principles. It reminds me what the engineering work actually feels like from the inside. That experiential memory informs how I think about the teams I lead and what I ask of them.

## What "Staying Hands-On" Actually Means at the Executive Level

It doesn't mean writing production code. It doesn't mean owning features or being in the on-call rotation. It doesn't mean competing with your team on technical problems they're better equipped to solve.

It means maintaining a practice of technical engagement that keeps your understanding current and your instincts sharp.

For me, that looks like:

**Side projects and personal experiments.** I've played with MicroPython on microcontrollers. I've experimented with vacuum tube electronics because the physics of the medium is genuinely fascinating and quite different from solid-state. I write helper scripts and small utilities for things I care about. I've rebuilt systems for personal projects using technologies I don't use professionally, specifically to understand them from the inside. None of this is production work. All of it keeps me current in ways that reading about technology doesn't.

**Code review and architecture review participation.** Not as the decision-maker, but as a participant. Asking questions in code review. Sitting in on architecture discussions not to direct them but to understand what the team is thinking and why. This keeps me connected to what the engineering team is actually doing and provides context that strategy conversations alone don't provide.

**Reading deeply rather than broadly on technical topics.** There's a lot of technology journalism that tells you what happened without explaining why or how. Going deeper — reading actual research papers, going through detailed technical specifications, following engineers who write thoughtfully about their craft — keeps the understanding at a level that supports real conversation rather than just surface familiarity.

**Staying engaged with the developer community.** Following the conversations happening in the places where practitioners talk to each other — forums, technical conferences, open source project discussions — provides a ground-level view of what's actually being used and what problems are being encountered in practice. This is often quite different from what vendor marketing and analyst reports suggest.

**Occasional pair programming or technical deep-dives with engineers.** Asking to sit with an engineer while they work through a problem is one of the most effective ways to maintain technical currency AND to build relationship with the engineering team. It has to be done right — you're there to observe and understand, not to direct — but when it's done right, it's valuable for both parties.

## The Time Problem

The honest objection to all of this is time. Executive roles are demanding, and the time you spend on technical side projects is time you're not spending on something else.

My answer is that the alternative — allowing your technical understanding to become entirely secondhand — has its own costs. The efficiency losses from bad technical decisions, from being unable to evaluate technical proposals clearly, from losing credibility with engineering teams — these are real costs, even if they're harder to measure than the time spent maintaining technical engagement.

The practice doesn't need to be extensive to be valuable. A few hours a week of genuinely focused technical engagement — a side project, a code review, a technical deep-dive on a topic that's relevant to your current decisions — is enough to maintain meaningful currency. It's less than most people spend on activities that are objectively less useful.

## What Curiosity Actually Looks Like

The thing that sustains technical currency is not discipline alone — it's genuine curiosity. I still find technology interesting. Not all of it, but enough of it, in enough unexpected corners, that maintaining engagement doesn't require an act of will.

The leaders who fall out of technical currency most quickly are usually the ones who lost the curiosity first. The job consumed all their attention, the interesting technical problems moved to other people's domains, and at some point they looked up and realized they were no longer someone who actually kept up with technology — they were someone who managed people who did.

If you're still finding things in technology genuinely interesting — still reading papers that excite you, still wanting to understand how things work, still experiencing that satisfying click of a concept becoming clear — that curiosity is worth protecting. It's what makes technical leadership engaging rather than just managerial, and it's what keeps your judgment grounded in reality rather than theory.

The work of leadership is important. The technical grounding that makes that leadership credible and effective is worth maintaining. Both things can be true — and in the best technology executives, they are.
